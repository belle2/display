# Belle II Event Display with Phoenix - GSoC 2023

This Angular CLI web app displays Belle II events using Phoenix, a TypeScript-based event display framework.

The web app can be accessed through [display.belle2.org](https://display.belle2.org).

In order to run the application on your local machine, please refer to the the [documentation](https://display.belle2.org/documentation/developer/installation.html).

The web application serves as a tool that allows physicists and non-physicists to import Belle II events from `.root` files, containing either collisions or simulated data, and view them directly in a web browser. By leveraging the Phoenix framework and adding custom features, the application provides a user-friendly environment for event display, complete with intuitive user interface controls.
