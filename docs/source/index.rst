Belle II Event Display
======================

**Belle II Event Display with Phoenix** is a project conducted during the Google Summer of Code 2023, aimed at providing a web-based tool for event display. The project's main objective is to enhance the usability and accessibility of Belle II results by allowing users to upload the *mdst .root* file and display the events on their browser. Both user documentation and developer documentation are included on this page.
